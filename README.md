# Jenga-tron-Robotic-Arm-Assisted-Jenga
Project goal: Design a versatile robotic arm for precise Jenga block manipulation. Implement advanced control algorithms for accuracy. Enable IoT-based remote control via Blynk app. Thorough testing and documentation for reliability and performance.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

This project aims at designing and constructing a versatile robotic arm system with multiple degrees of freedom, specifically tailored for interacting with Jenga blocks. The system will incorporate a program to pick the Jenga blocks at a specific place, enabling precise and controlled movements. Advanced control algorithms will be implemented to facilitate accurate and coordinated manipulation of the robotic arm. To enhance user experience, an Internet of Things (IoT) will be designed, providing seamless interaction and control of the robotic arm system. Using the “Blynk” app as an IoT platform allows the user to remotely control the robotic arm by the use of a smartphone. Extensive testing and optimization will be conducted to ensure the system's reliability, stability, and overall performance, while comprehensive documentation will capture the entire development process, including design specifications, software code, and hardware schematics.
